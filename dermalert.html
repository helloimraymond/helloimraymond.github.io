        Individuals with skin sensitivities (eczema, rosacea, etc.) often face challenges in managing their condition after undergoing patch tests, as they receive minimal support to help them effectively avoid allergens/irritants in everyday skincare products.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Solution<span class="green-dot">.</span></span><br/>
        DermAlert is a personalized web-based repository that helps sufferers of skin sensitivities easily identify and avoid allergens in skincare product ingredients by offering tailored search results based on their unique sensitivities and patch test findings.

        With this personalized tool, I hope to empower individuals to make informed skincare choices, reducing reactions and improving skin health. I also wish to receive input from experts to make DermAlert a resource dermatologists feel comfortable recommending to patients.

    <!-- Add your process images and text here as needed -->
    <p>Individuals with skin sensitivities often have problems effectively avoiding allergens and irritants in everyday skincare products, with many receiving insufficient support from their dermatologists following their patch tests. Current platforms do not adequately address the challenges patients face. After the research/empathize phase, I was able to break down the problem into three common issues users had to deal with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The names of allergens on patch tests rarely match their names on ingredient lists.</li>
      <li>Current platforms require users to manually input ingredients to filter.</li>
      <li>Other platforms don’t have a comprehensive inventory of products,  focusing only on cosmetics.</li>
    </ul>
