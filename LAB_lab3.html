            <p>I swapped storyboards with Roy. For his storyboard, Roy added supplemental notes about what was happening in the game, as well clarification about the interactive elements. He also utilized a basic colour coding system for his storyboard, with in-game actions drawn in blue, and user controls drawn in red. He also did a much better job drafting his storyboard compared to mine 😬. These differences enhanced the storyboards, making it much clearer and easier to follow. The reader of the storyboard wouldn’t have too many issues trying to decipher what the flow of the story is, which is much more than I can say about mine. Considering the differences in our work, I would add notes to expand on both in-game actions and user controls rather than have the onus of understanding fall onto the user.</p>
            <p>Based on the lecture and lab, I would say the previsualization process for linear and non-linear media differs in the way we tell the story. While both types of media involve a great deal of storytelling, with non-linear media, you have to take into account user controls. This could be achieved in many ways (as exemplified in our lab), but it requires more options/sub-stories than in linear media.</p>
